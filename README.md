## Code Invaders

Code Invaders is a mobile application that helps users to improve their programming knowledge, especially debugging, in an entertaining and exciting way. This game has a similar gameplay to "Space Invaders" but spaceships will have a look based on the logos of programming languages and the enemies will be bugs. The current available spaceships / programming languages are C++, Java and Python. This game was developed using Cordova and Phaser 3.
